##  Project Objective  

RefinedTech is an online marketplace designed to make buying and selling used tech gadgets simple, safe, and smart. Our goal is to:
- Connect buyers and sellers of pre-owned electronics (phones, laptops, gaming gear) in one trusted platform.  
- Prevent scams with AI-powered fraud detection for all listings. 
- Guarantee fair deals using escrow payments - your money is only released when you receive the item.
- Simplify decisions with verified condition ratings (Like-new/Good/Fair) and real photos.
- Save you time with smart recommendations based on your preferences.

No more sketchy Craigslist deals - just easy, secure tech trading!
